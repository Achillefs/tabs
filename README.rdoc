== The Little Tab Buddy

This project started out when I wanted to learn how to properly use Capybara and Selenium. I chose to make a little app that lets you input guitar tabs using only the computer keyboard in a conmfortable manner. It sports keyboard tab navigation, tab reset with Ctl+Backspace, basic tab validation and Tab save with Cmd+S. That's pretty much all it does, but, since I actually found myself using it a lot in the past couple of years to share licks and ideas with band mates, here it is!
